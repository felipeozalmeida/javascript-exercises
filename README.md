# Javascript exercise list

This repository is intended to showcase my abilities, oops, publish some Javascript exercises that I've got to do in college [**UPDATE** 4/22/19: I've modified (and I'm modifying) them a little bit to make things interesting]. Since there's a LOT of them, I'll be adding each one as I solve along with their descriptions. With this, I hope that who's learning JS find it useful.

Disclaimer: I'm not worried about backward compatibility here as I'm doing this for fun (sorry Babel).

## Table of contents

1. [Module of 5](#module-of-5)
2. [Sum of 1 over n](#sum-of-1-over-n)
3. [1 to 10 times tables](#1-10-times-tables)
4. [Array sorting](#array-sorting)
5. [Shopping discounts](#shopping-discounts)
6. [Higher profit](#higher-profit)
7. [Older than 17](#older-than-17)
8. [Age groups](#age-groups)
9. [N times table](#n-times-table)
10. [Transactions](#transactions)

## Quick start

Just for you to get experience using npm in case you don't have. The commands below will install and enable [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) (a nice opiniated code formatter by the way)!

1. Install node
2. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/felipeozalmeida/javascript-exercises.git`
3. Run: `npm install`

## Exercises

I didn't set up difficulty levels for each one because they can be improved almost indefinitely. If you don't know how to approach each problem or want to apply all the JS concepts that you're learning, I suggest the following progressive workflow:

1. Solve it the simplest way first;
2. Render your app in the DOM;
3. Set up a notification system;
4. Fake a client server communication;
5. Make use of object oriented JS.

Good luck and have fun!
