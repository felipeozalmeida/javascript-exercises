# javascript-exercises
This repo is intended to showcase my abilities, oops, publish some Javascript exercises that I've got to do in college. As there's a LOT of them, I'll be adding each one as long as I solve them. In the future, I plan to put the exercises here, but don't expect that anytime soon.

Disclaimer: I'm not worried about backward compatibility here as I'm doing this for fun (sorry Babel).
